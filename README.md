# sup

a rust CLI project. 

Pretty loose plan so far, but I wanted to experiment with Rust building a CLI tool for text manipulation & productivity tooling

I figure it'll largely be a frontend to other tools, eg. 
- Obsidian notes, using [Obsidian URI](https://help.obsidian.md/Advanced+topics/Using+Obsidian+URI)
- text / taskpaper todos, perhaps via [na](https://brettterpstra.com/projects/na/)
- [harsh](https://github.com/wakatara/harsh)
- chatGPT, because it's 2023
